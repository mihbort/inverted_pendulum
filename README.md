### Made by Misha Bortnikov in 2017
### Lego Mindstorms EV3 inverted pendulum implementation

This project represents implementation of classical control theory task â€” be able to control unstable dynamical system with center of mass above its pivot point.
It is a home task #4 of System Identifiaction and Symulation course. See video with detailed explanation.

### Work process
It is possible to program Lego Mindstorms robots using a few instruments:
- LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition
- LEGO C IDE
- Special Python Package
- Matlab

It was interesting for me to implement this task in way close to that intended by the manufacturer, so I choosed **LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home Edition**.

Before build this robot I had searched the net and found that this task is already solved on LEGO robots, but there is no concise way to do it. Moreover, constructions of this robot is different for each project and usualy contains not used components. So I build my own minimalistic structure.
